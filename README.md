# Data Glacier Week 12: Persistency of a Drug (continued)

**Business Problem**

Medication persistence refers to a patient’s continued action of taking medications for the duration instructed by the prescriber. Therefore, persistency of a drug is a critical factor which contributes to industry profits as well as patient outcomes. Using data in real cases, a machine learning model can learn relationships between target variables (persistence) and dependent variables, such as patient related variables, prescriber attributes, and indicators of disease severity (e.g.: DEXA scans, t-scores of the bone, and history of bone fractures) at the beginning and during the therapy. Eventually, the model will be able to predict whether the patient will be persistent in medication therapy, given the values of dependent variables.

**Project Description**

A model will be established and deployed to automate identifying persistency of a certain pharmaceutical product. Records of 3,424 patients who take the medication will be used for analysis, and correlation between medication persistency and other factors such as patient demographics, provider attributes, clinical factors, and disease factors will be investigated. Finally, an optimal model to predict persistency based on above features will be selected and developed.

**Development of a Model**

Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), and MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLP) were compared using seven independent variables selected via recursive factor elimination (RFE). LR achieved AUC of 80.5% and accuracy of 81.9%. The model was saved as a .pkl file for Paas deployment.
